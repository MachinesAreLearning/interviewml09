## Key Insight: Internal vs External Interviews

Internal interviews are **NOT about resume validation** — they assume you're already competent.

Instead, they focus on:
- **Skill Calibration:** Can you operate at the next level?
- **Scope Readiness:** Can you handle broader responsibility?
- **Cultural Fit at Scale:** Do you embody bank-grade maturity?

## The 6 Typical Interview Rounds

| Round | Focus Area | What They're Testing |
|-------|------------|---------------------|
| 1. Technical Foundation | Python, SQL, DS, ML basics | Can you still code? Do you understand fundamentals? |
| 2. AI/ML Deep Dive | Model choices, architectures, validation | Do you understand WHY, not just WHAT? |
| 3. GenAI/Agentic AI | RAG, agents, LangChain, governance | Are you current? Can you lead AI initiatives? |
| 4. System/Platform Design | End-to-end AI platform, MLOps | Can you architect at scale? |
| 5. Behavioral & Leadership | Failures, conflicts, decisions | How do you lead through ambiguity? |
| 6. Hiring Manager/Bar Raiser | Ownership, judgment, vision | Should we bet on you? |

## Critical Skill: Depth Switching

You must be able to switch levels **within seconds**:

```
Whiteboard → Architecture → Code → Governance
   ↑              ↑           ↑         ↑
 10,000 ft    System-level   Hands-on   Risk lens
```

**Example Transition:**
- "Here's the high-level architecture..." (whiteboard)
- "The retrieval layer uses FAISS with HNSW indexing..." (architecture)
- "In Python, this would be `index.search(query_vector, k=5)`..." (code)
- "We version embeddings and maintain audit logs for compliance..." (governance)

## What Makes Internal Interviews Different

| Aspect | External Interview | Internal Interview |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Resume Deep-Dive | Heavy | Minimal |
| Current Role Questions | N/A | "What have you delivered?" |
| Cultural Assessment | High | Already known |
| Skill Gap Analysis | General | Specific to target role |
| Stakeholder References | None | Back-channel feedback exists |

## Your Advantage as Internal Candidate

1. **Context:** You understand the bank's constraints
2. **Track Record:** Your work is visible and verifiable
3. **Relationships:** You can reference actual collaborations
4. **Domain:** You know regulatory/risk requirements

## Your Risk as Internal Candidate

1. **Familiarity Bias:** "We know Rishi, but can he do THIS role?"
2. **Ceiling Perception:** They may have anchored you at current level
3. **Baggage:** Any past friction is remembered
4. **Higher Bar:** Internal candidates often held to higher standard

---

## Preparation Strategy

For each round, prepare:

1. **3 Strong Stories** — Different angles, same excellence
2. **Technical Depth** — Go deeper than they expect
3. **Strategic Framing** — Every answer ties to business impact
4. **Bank Context** — Reference risk, governance, scale

## Quick Self-Assessment

Before each mock interview, ask yourself:

- [ ] Can I explain my work to a technical bar raiser?
- [ ] Can I defend my architectural decisions?
- [ ] Can I code a solution live without freezing?
- [ ] Can I articulate failures with maturity?
- [ ] Can I paint a vision for what I'd build next?
