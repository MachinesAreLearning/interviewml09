## Key Preparation Themes

### 1. Depth Switching
You must switch levels instantly during interviews:
```
Whiteboard → Architecture → Code → Governance
```

### 2. Bank-Grade Maturity
Every answer should reflect:
- Regulatory awareness
- Risk consciousness
- Governance mindset
- Audit readiness

### 3. "Why" Over "What"
At VP level, they test judgment:
- Why did you choose this approach?
- What trade-offs did you consider?
- How did you handle failure?
